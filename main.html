	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient:To express the time complexity of an algorithm, we use something called the “Big O notation”. The Big O notation is a language we use to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, and helps us to make decisions.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>,O(n):Space complexity is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space. Space complexity is dependent on several factors.</p>
